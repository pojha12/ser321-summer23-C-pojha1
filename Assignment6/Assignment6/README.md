SER-321:  Assignment 6

### Activity: Distributed System gRPC
For Task 1, the purpose of this program was to implement additional services to the server (Node.java) and allow the client (EchoClient.java) to select the service desired.  The gRPC protocol is used for the server/client communication.  The services included are echo, joke, zoo, calculator, and golf.  
The echo service allows the client to send a message to the server and have the server echos the message back to the client. 
The joke services allows the client to set a joke and get a number of jokes. 
The zoo service allows the client to add an animal along with the sound it makes to the "zoo" and get the sound back. It can also return a list of all the animals added. 
The calc service allows the user to input two values and the fucntions(PLUS,MIUNS,MULTIPLY,DIVIDE). It can also return a histroy of the calculations done. 
In Task 2, the golf service was created to allow the client to record a golf score using name, course name, date, and golf score. It can also return a list of all the scores added.

In Task 3, an additional client (Client.java) and server (NodeService.java) was created to use the registry server compared to the server with the service.  This was to simulate a real world example of a client not knowning the services server address and port. 

### GRPC Services and Registry
- The following folder contains a Registry.jar which includes a Registering service where Nodes can register to allow clients to find them and use their implemented GRPC services.
- Some more detailed explanations will follow and please also check the build.gradle file
- Before starting do a "gradle generateProto".

### gradle runRegistryServer
- Will run the Registry node on localhost (arguments are possible see gradle). This node will run and allows nodes to register themselves.
- The Server allows Protobuf, JSON and gRPC. We will only be using gRPC

### gradle runNode
- Will run a node with an Echo and Joke service. The node registers itself on the Registry. You can change the host and port the node runs on and this will register accordingly with the Registry

### gradle runClientJava
- Will run a client which will call the services from the node, it talks to the node directly not through the registry. At the end the client does some calls to the Registry to pull the services, this will be needed later.

### gradle runDiscovery
- Will create a couple of threads with each running a node with services in JSON and Protobuf. This is just an example and not needed for assignment 6.

### gradle testProtobufRegistration
- Registers the protobuf nodes from runDiscovery and do some calls.

### gradle testJSONRegistration
- Registers the json nodes from runDiscovery and do some calls.

## Requirements Met
### Task 1: Starting services locally (50 points)
1. (3 points) Must have: We need to be able to run the service node through "gradle
runNode" which should use default arguments, and the client through "gradle runClientJava" using the correct default values to connect to the started service node!!!! If this does not work we will not run things.
2. (20 points each service) Implement 2 from the 4 services that are given in the .proto files, choose from these 4 protos: zoo, calculator, coffee, bank Read through the Protobuf files for more details on how the services are supposed to work.
3. (8 points) Your client should let the user decide what they want to do with some
nice terminal input easy to understand, e.g. first showing all the available services,
then asking the user which service they want to use, then asking for the input the
service needs. Good overall client that does not crash.
4. (4 points) Give the option that we can run "gradle runClient -Phost=host -Pport=port -Pauto=1" which will run all requests on its own with input data you hardcode and give good output results and also of course shows what was called. This will call the server directly without using any registry. So basically shows your test cases running successfully. See video about Task 1 for more details.
5. (5 points) Server and Client should be robust and not crash.
### Task 2: Creating a service (Golf service)
1. Service allows at least two different requests
2. Each request needs at least one input
3. Response returns different data for different requests
4. Response returns a repeated field
5. Data is held persistent on the server
### Task 3.1: Register locally
1. MUST: Create a new version of your Node.java ==> NodeService.java and your
EchoClient.java ==> Client.java. You should be able to call them through "gradle
registerServiceNode" and "gradle runClient2" asking for the same parameters as the
calls that were already in the given Gradle file for the original files. This call will use the Registry again, so is not the same as runClient from the previous task. These should use default values so that they connect correctly!
2. Test this: Run your Registry, run your node (you need to provide the correct host
and port of course) â€“ you should set this as default values for us. You should see a
println on the Registry side that the service is registered. If you do not, try to figure out what happened (or did not happen).
3. Now, you should run your Client (also with the parts included which you need to
uncomment now) and see if it will find the registered services correctly with the
regOn flag as true.
4. (8 points) If all this works, adapt your client so it does not just call the service on the node you provide directly as was done in Task 1 but that the client can choose between all services registered on the Registry (in this case locally it will still just be your services. For testing purposes you can run a couple server nodes and register all of them to your local registry. You do not hard code which server to talk to anymore but use the following workflow:
a. Client contacts Registry to check for available services
b. List all registered services in the terminal and the client can choose one 
c. (You should basically have this already) Based on what the client chooses the
terminal should ask for input, eg. a new sentence, a sorting array or whatever
the request needs
d. The request should be sent to one of the available service nodes with the following workflow: 1) client should call the registry again and ask for a Server
providing the chosen service 2) the returned server should then be used, 3)
should send the request to the server that was returned, 4) return the response
in a good way to the client
e. Make sure that your Client does not crash in case the Server did not respond
or crashed. Make it as robust as possible.


## How to run the program
### Task 1 & 2: Run in Terminal with default values

For Node: run "gradle runNode" 
Defaults: registryHost="localhost" | grpcPort=9002 | serviceHost="localhost" | servicePort=8000 | nodeName="test"
  
For EchoClient: run "gradle runClientJava"
Defaults: serviceHost="localhost" | servicePort=8000 auto=1

### Task 1 & 2: Run in Terminal with custom values

For Node: run "gradle runNode -PregistryHost=<String> -PgrpcPort=<int> -PserviceHost=<string> -PservicePort=<int> -PnodeName=<string>" 

serviceHost, servicePort, nodeName are critical for operations. Task 1 & 2 don't use the registryHost & grpcPort; they are still required (use default values)
 
For EchoClient: run "gradle runClientJava -PserviceHost=<string> -PservicePort=<int> -Pauto=0"
auto=1: automatically runs program with calls and auto=0: user prompts


### Task 3: Run in Terminal with default values

For runRegistryServer: run "gradle runRegistryServer" 
Default: protobufPort=9000 | jsonPort=9001 | grpcPort=9002

For registerServiceNode: run "gradle registerServiceNode" 
Default: registryHost="localhost" | grpcPort=9002 | serviceHost="localhost" | servicePort=8000 | nodeName="test"

For Client: run "gradle runClient2"
Default: serviceHost="localhost" | servicePort=8000 | registryHost="localhost" | grpcPort=9002


### Task 3: Run in Terminal with custom values

For runRegistryServer: run "gradle runRegistryServer -PprotobufPort=<int> -PjsonPort=<int> -PgrpcPort=<int>" 
make sure the port values are correct 

For registerServiceNode: run "gradle registerServiceNode -PregistryHost=<string> -PgrpcPort=<int> -PserviceHost=<string> -PservicePort=<int> -PnodeName=<string>" 

host and port values correlate to the corresponding nodes

For Client: run "gradle runClient2 -PserviceHost=<string> -PservicePort=<int> -PregistryHost=<string> -PgrpcPort=<int>" 
host and port values correlate to the corresponding nodes 
**commands 4 and 5 in task 3 are opposite**
